# Library Dash

This game was created by Riddhi Lamba in July 2023 during the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program to address the theme of "hope". It was inspired by the hope and joy that books can bring to a person's life and originally created on Repl.it using script.js.

All the code and assets used to create the game can be found in the "Library Dash" directory.
