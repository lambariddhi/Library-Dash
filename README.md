# Library Dash

This game was created by Riddhi Lamba in July 2023 to address the theme of "hope". It was inspired by the hope and joy that books can bring to a person's life.
 
You can play it here: http://riddhi-l-gamejam.riddhil.repl.co/

All the code used to create the game can be found in the "Library Dash" directory.
